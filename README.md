# Customer Support System

## Overview
This is a comprehensive customer support system that allows users to submit tickets through multiple channels: website, email, and Telegram. All tickets are synchronized within the system, ensuring smooth management and enabling support agents to respond more quickly to customer requests.

## Project Status
This project is currently under development. The features mentioned below are planned but not fully functional yet. Contributions and feedback are welcome as the system is being actively built.

## Features
- **Multi-channel ticket submission**: Users can submit support tickets via:
  - Website
  - Email
  - Telegram
- **Ticket synchronization**: All tickets, regardless of the source, are fully synchronized within the system for easier management and tracking.
- **Fast response**: Thanks to synchronization and an optimized workflow, support agents can quickly respond to customer requests and resolve issues.

## How It Works
1. A customer submits a ticket from any supported channel (website, email, Telegram).
2. The ticket is instantly synchronized with the support system and assigned to an available agent.

4. All communications and ticket statuses are updated in real time across all platforms.

## Requirements
